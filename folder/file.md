## **2. Introduction to Relational Database and SQL**  

### **Slide 2: What is a Relational Database?**  
- A **relational database** is a structured collection of data organized into tables with predefined relationships.  
- Uses **primary keys and foreign keys** to maintain relationships.  

### **Slide 3: Why Use Relational Databases?**  
- **Data Integrity** – Ensures consistency and accuracy.  
- **Scalability** – Efficient data management for growing applications.  
- **Security** – Controlled access using authentication and authorization.  
- **ACID Compliance** – Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.  

### **Slide 4: Introduction to SQL**  
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is used for managing and querying relational databases.  
- Standard SQL commands:  
  - **DDL** – Data Definition Language (CREATE, ALTER, DROP).  
  - **DML** – Data Manipulation Language (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  
  - **DCL** – Data Control Language (GRANT, REVOKE).  
  - **TCL** – Transaction Control Language (COMMIT, ROLLBACK).  

### **Slide 5: SQL Commands**  
- **SELECT** – Retrieves data from tables.  
- **INSERT INTO** – Adds new records.  
- **UPDATE** – Modifies existing records.  
- **DELETE** – Removes records.  
- **JOIN** – Combines records from multiple tables.  

### **Slide 6: Example SQL Query**  
```sql
SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 25;
```
- Retrieves all users older than 25.

## **3. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  

### **Slide 7: What is TDD?**  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development approach where tests are written **before** code.  
- Follows the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle.  

### **Slide 8: TDD Cycle**  
1. **Write a test** that fails (Red).  
2. **Write code** to pass the test (Green).  
3. **Refactor the code** for efficiency.  

### **Slide 9: Benefits of TDD**  
- Reduces bugs in production.  
- Improves code design and readability.  
- Enhances maintainability and refactoring.  

### **Slide 10: Example of TDD in Action**  
- Write a failing test case in Python:  
```python
def test_addition():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
```
- Implement the function:  
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
- Run tests and refactor if necessary.

## **4. How Cloud Computing Helps Businesses**  

### **Slide 11: What is Cloud Computing?**  
- **Cloud computing** provides on-demand computing resources over the internet.  
- Examples: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.  

### **Slide 12: Benefits of Cloud Computing for Businesses**  
- **Cost-Effective** – Pay-as-you-go model.  
- **Scalability** – Easily scales up/down.  
- **Security** – Advanced data encryption and protection.  
- **Accessibility** – Access from anywhere.  

### **Slide 13: Types of Cloud Services**  
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – Virtual machines, storage (e.g., AWS EC2).  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – Development platforms (e.g., Google App Engine).  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – Cloud-hosted apps (e.g., Google Drive, Zoom).  

### **Slide 14: Case Study on Cloud Adoption**  
- Netflix uses AWS to **stream content globally**.  
- Startups use **Google Cloud** for AI and machine learning.

## **5. How Analytics Helps Businesses**  

### **Slide 15: What is Business Analytics?**  
- **Business analytics** involves data-driven decision-making.  
- Uses **data mining, AI, and statistical analysis**.  

### **Slide 16: Types of Business Analytics**  
1. **Descriptive Analytics** – Summarizes past data.  
2. **Diagnostic Analytics** – Explains reasons behind trends.  
3. **Predictive Analytics** – Forecasts future trends.  
4. **Prescriptive Analytics** – Suggests best actions.  

### **Slide 17: Benefits of Business Analytics**  
- **Improves decision-making** with data insights.  
- **Enhances customer experience** with personalization.  
- **Reduces costs** by optimizing operations.  

### **Slide 18: Case Studies**  
- Amazon uses **predictive analytics** for recommendations.  
- Airlines use **prescriptive analytics** for pricing strategies.

## **6. OWASP Top 10 Security Risks**  

### **Slide 19: What is OWASP?**  
- **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** provides security guidelines.  

### **Slide 20: OWASP Top 10 Risks**  
1. Injection  
2. Broken Authentication  
3. Sensitive Data Exposure  
4. XML External Entities (XXE)  
5. Broken Access Control  
6. Security Misconfiguration  
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
8. Insecure Deserialization  
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities  
10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring  

### **Slide 21: Example of an OWASP Security Risk**  
- **SQL Injection Attack:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1';
```
- **Mitigation:** Use **prepared statements** and **input validation**.  

### **Slide 22: How to Mitigate Security Risks?**  
- Implement **input validation** and **encryption**.  
- Regular **security testing** (penetration testing).  
- Follow **secure coding practices**.
